# Lidar-tool-tutorial
This is a small tutorial of how can someone use the Pulsed Lidar tool simulator that was created 
for the purposes of my MSc thesis titled "Implementation of virtual LIDARs in LES for wake analysis". 
The code for the complete simulator can be found here: https://github.com/RanTanPLanN/Git-Pulsed-Lidar-simulator

The explanation of the tutorial can be found inside the MSc thesis report. Note that the tutorial is ready to run, all the user has to do is to run PulsedLidarSim script.
